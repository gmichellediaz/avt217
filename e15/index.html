    <p>open xd</p>
    <p>create a file with a width of 1090px and a height of 975 pixels</p>
    <p>select the triangle tool and draw out a triangle towards the middle of the page (the page will stay as the default white background)</p>
    <p>to the right, adjust the width and height of the triangle to be w:400 and h:300</p>
    <p>to be more specific, the x and y measurements will be x:345 and y:212</p>
    <p>select the triangle and change the fill color to be a hex value of #FFEB00, which should be a shade of yellow</p>
    <p>next we will create a face</p>
    <p>select the circle tool and create two circles of the same size, which would be w:22 h:21. The circles have no border and the fill value is black, also known as hex value of #000000</p>
    <p>the left "eye" is positioned at a x:479 y:362</p>
    <p>the right "eye" is positioned at a x:581 y:362</p>
    <p>next we will make a mouth</p>
    <p>select the circle tool and create an oval shape with no border, with the fill color as white, also known as the hex code #FFFFFF</p>
    <p>adjust the size of oval to be w:76 h:29 x:507 y:400</p>
    <p>the final steps we will be creating arms and legs for the triangle</p>
    <p>select the line tool and draw a line and change the size to 4, and the border will be black (hex #000000)</p>
    <p>adjust width and heights to w:100 h:34 x:390 y:414.5</p>
    <p>now select that, copy and paste</p>
    <p>now drag that out to the right, which will make the right arm</p>
    <p>for the right arm, adjust the x and y values to x:652.5 y:338.5</p>
    <p>final steps will be the triangles legs</p>
    <p>select the line tool once again, and create 2 lines with a size 4 border, and border color of black (hex #000000)</p>
    <p>the left leg will have a width and height of w: 0.5 h:51</p>
    <p>x and y values of the left leg will be x:478.5 y:512</p>
    <p>now the right leg will have the same width and height of w:0.5 and h:51, but the x and y values will be x:620.5 y:512</p>
    <p>and that should be it for the drawing. a dabbing triangle..... lol.</p>
    <p>now save and export that image and email it to me at gdiaz6@gmu.edu</p>
